# A Landing page project about cats

A landing page project using HTML/CSS

I did this project as a challenge proposed at the end of the module of HTML/CSS at the RocketSeat (https://app.rocketseat.com.br) explorer course, this one focused in the use of variables, animations, grids and responsiveness in CSS.

The project is available at: https://project-cat-blog.vercel.app/
